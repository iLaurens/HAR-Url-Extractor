A friend of mine uses the Firefox plugin ConsoleExport for Firebug
that allows him to export a HAR file with data about the loading
of a page. He wanted to get a sorted list of all the object urls
for that saved page load result. However he didn't want to do that
manually. That's why I created this simple parser.

The extension in question can be found here:
